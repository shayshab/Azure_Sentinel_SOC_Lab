## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### Query Optimization
1. **Always use time filters** to limit data scope
2. **Use `project`** to select only needed columns
3. **Add `take` or `limit`** for large result sets
4. **Use `summarize`** early to reduce data volume

### Performance Tips
1. **Cache frequently used data** in variables
2. **Use `bin()`** for time-based aggregations
3. **Avoid `extend`** with complex calculations on large datasets
4. **Test queries** with small time ranges first

### Security Considerations
1. **Never log sensitive data** in queries
2. **Use parameterized queries** for alerts
3. **Validate input data** before processing
4. **Monitor query performance** and costs
