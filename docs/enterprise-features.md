    FailedLogins = countif(EventID == 4625),
    Logoffs = countif(EventID == 4634)
    by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| extend ComplianceScore = case(
    FailedLogins > 10, "High Risk",
    FailedLogins > 5, "Medium Risk",
    "Low Risk"
)
```

| where EventID in (4663, 4660, 4656)
| where ObjectName contains "personal" or ObjectName contains "customer"
| project TimeGenerated, Account, ObjectName, AccessMask
| extend DataSensitivity = case(
    ObjectName contains "personal", "High",
    ObjectName contains "customer", "Medium",
    "Low"
)
```

- Communications Security (A.13)

## 🔍 Threat Intelligence Integration

### IOC (Indicators of Compromise) Management

**Purpose**: Integrate threat intelligence feeds for proactive defense

**Implementation Steps**:

1. **Create IOC Watchlist**
   ```kql
   // IOC Detection Query
   let maliciousIPs = _GetWatchlist('threat-intel-ips');
   let maliciousDomains = _GetWatchlist('threat-intel-domains');
   
   SecurityEvent
   | where EventID == 4625
   | lookup maliciousIPs on $left.IpAddress == $right.IP
   | extend ThreatLevel = case(
       isnotempty(ThreatScore), "High",
       "Low"
     )
   ```

2. **Threat Feed Integration**
   - Import threat intelligence CSV files
   - Configure automatic updates
   - Set up reputation scoring

### Reputation Scoring System

**Purpose**: Score IP addresses based on threat intelligence

**Scoring Criteria**:
- **High Risk (80-100)**: Known malicious IPs
- **Medium Risk (40-79)**: Suspicious activity
- **Low Risk (0-39)**: Clean IPs

**Implementation**:
```kql
// IP Reputation Scoring
let geo = _GetWatchlist('geoip');
let threatIntel = _GetWatchlist('threat-intel');

SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625
| lookup geo on $left.IpAddress == $right.Network
| lookup threatIntel on $left.IpAddress == $right.IP
| extend ReputationScore = coalesce(ThreatScore, 0)
| extend RiskLevel = case(
    ReputationScore >= 80, "High",
    ReputationScore >= 40, "Medium",
    "Low"
  )
```

## 🤖 Automation & Orchestration

### Incident Response Playbooks

**Purpose**: Automate incident response workflows

**Available Playbooks**:

1. **Brute Force Attack Response**
   ```json
   {
     "trigger": "Brute Force Detection",
     "actions": [
       "Block IP Address",
       "Create Incident Ticket",
       "Send Alert to Security Team",
       "Update Threat Intelligence"
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Data Breach Response**
   ```json
   {
     "trigger": "Suspicious Data Access",
     "actions": [
       "Isolate Affected Systems",
       "Notify Legal Team",
       "Initiate Forensics",
       "Update Compliance Dashboard"
     ]
   }
   ```

### Automated Threat Blocking

**Purpose**: Automatically block malicious IPs

**Implementation**:
```kql
// Automated Blocking Logic
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625
| summarize count() by IpAddress, bin(TimeGenerated, 5m)
| where count_ > 10
| extend BlockReason = "Brute Force Attack"
| project IpAddress, BlockReason, TimeGenerated
```

## 📊 Advanced Analytics

### Machine Learning Anomaly Detection

**Purpose**: Detect unusual patterns using ML

**Implementation**:
```kql
// Anomaly Detection for Login Patterns
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625
| summarize 
    LoginAttempts = count(),
    UniqueIPs = dcount(IpAddress),
    UniqueAccounts = dcount(Account)
    by bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| extend AnomalyScore = case(
    LoginAttempts > avg(LoginAttempts) * 2, "High",
    LoginAttempts > avg(LoginAttempts) * 1.5, "Medium",
    "Normal"
  )
```

### Behavioral Analysis

**Purpose**: Monitor user behavior patterns

**Key Metrics**:
- Login time patterns
- Geographic access patterns
- Resource access patterns
- Privilege escalation attempts

**Implementation**:
```kql
// User Behavior Analysis
SecurityEvent
| where EventID in (4624, 4625)
| summarize 
    TotalLogins = countif(EventID == 4624),
    FailedLogins = countif(EventID == 4625),
    UniqueLocations = dcount(IpAddress)
    by Account, bin(TimeGenerated, 1d)
| extend BehaviorScore = case(
    FailedLogins > 5, "Suspicious",
    UniqueLocations > 3, "Unusual",
    "Normal"
  )
```

## 📈 Executive Reporting

### Executive Dashboard

**Purpose**: Provide high-level security metrics for leadership

**Key Metrics**:
- Security posture score
- Threat landscape overview
- Compliance status
- Incident trends
- Risk assessment

**Implementation**:
```kql
// Executive Summary Query
let securityEvents = SecurityEvent | where TimeGenerated > ago(30d);
let failedLogins = securityEvents | where EventID == 4625;
let successfulLogins = securityEvents | where EventID == 4624;

securityEvents
| summarize 
    TotalEvents = count(),
    FailedAttempts = countif(EventID == 4625),
    SuccessfulLogins = countif(EventID == 4624),
    UniqueAttackers = dcount(IpAddress)
    by bin(TimeGenerated, 1d)
| extend SecurityScore = 100 - (FailedAttempts * 10)
| project TimeGenerated, SecurityScore, TotalEvents, UniqueAttackers
```
